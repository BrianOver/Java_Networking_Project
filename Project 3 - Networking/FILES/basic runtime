open
create serversocket
3 lists:
sockets
bufferedreader
printwriter
cycle through txt doc and build cards red/green lists
prompt host or connect
host => HOST 
connect => CONNECT

-HOST-
*find a way to poll for users (basic: join, add another? y/n)*
for join:
add new component to each list for each user
@end of connection phase send out each IP (except each users)
go to GREEN

-CONNECT-
prompt user for IP
create:
sockets
bufferedreader
Printwriter
Poll for IP(s) from host (wait for “*”)
go to RED

-GREEN-
remove:re-store:send to reds a green card
check input buffers until all have sent in cards
send out all cards to reds
send out a copy of the card now with boolean for winner
go to RED

-RED-
(first time) remove 7 red cards to an array
remove card to green
replace with new draw
switch to receive
get red cards
get winner
if winner:
go to GREEN
else
go to RED


**Design Problems**
how does go to green without the other sockets? probably need to fix that
static host that runs in background of one?
switching host? needs all the sockets to transfer at some point
